# To Do list: interactive list
 -The goal of this project is to add some functionality to your application to make it interactive. The user will also be able to mark task completion by selecting the corresponding checkbox (or undo it by unchecking the checkbox). The updated tasks list will be stored in local storage.

# Project requirements
- Add a new JavaScript file and import it as a module:
- it will contain methods related to the status updates (completed: true / false).
- Add event listener to the checkbox (change).
- Update items object's value for completed key upon user actions.
- Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use filter() method).
- Store the updated array of items in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page reloads.
